# Pythin_API_Challenge
This repository contains the work done the Python_API_Challenge where data was extracted from Open Weather API and Geoapify API.
The challenge had two sections.
##Weather Challenge:
The purpose of this challenge was to extract the data from the Open Weather API for weather information of a list of locations identified from longitudes and latitudes. The data is then cleaned to create a DataFrame containing longitude, latitude, city, country, wind speed, cloudiness, Max temperature and Humidity.
The data has then been used for calculating and creating different plots and linear regression to analyze further.
##Vacation Challenge
The second criteria was in using the cities.csv file created to narrow down a set of cities based on personal weather preferences and finding hotels within those cities and plotting these in maps.
